# HitPredict

This repository contains the code and other assets of the "Hit Predict" team's Deep Learning homework. 

In order to make the code work you need to download a subset of the Million Song Dataset from [here](http://static.echonest.com/millionsongsubset_full.tar.gz) and extract it in the project's root directory.
